--Detailed Steps--

-- Player Movement--
1. Create a player scene. 
2. Create a tile class and simply spawn a 10x10 tile grid for player to move on.
3. Player movement with mouse control.
4. when player clicks on a tile get that tiles grid location.
5. Set up path finding to move from player position to tile location

-- Player and Enemy Stats --
1. Create a basic enemy, all other enemies will inherit from this one.
2. Set enemy sprite as an enemy from tile sheet.
3. Create a class called stats. It will contain strength and defense.
4. Attach this script to player and enemy.

-- Dungeon Generation - Part 1 --

This step has already been completed, just spawn a 10x10 room.
More sophiscated Generation, with halls and multple rooms will be established in part 2.

-- Turn System --
1. Create a singleton that manages the turns.
2. Create a list of of Node2Ds
3. When the player spawns add it to the list.
4. When enemy spawns. Add it to the list.
5. When an enemy dies, remove it from the list.
6. Make a function that clears list on changing of rooms.
7. For main use of of this turn manager, have an async function that cycles thru the node2d list.
8. Each enemy and player will have a turn_completed signal that will emit after each turn.
9. when this signal is emitted, the for loop will cycle forward.
10. Each step of this forloop will check if it's an enemy or player.
11. If player then wait for player to make an action.
12. If enemy, then run the enemy ai function in the enemy script

-- Enemy AI --
1. Have enemy wander about randomly, if not sleeping.
2. Create a field of view algorithm so it can detect the player.
3. If player is detected, chase the player.

-- Enemy AI - Part 2 --
1. Extract all AI bits from enemy.cs and put it in a script called enemyAI.cs.
2. There will be 3 types of AI
	- Aggressive: Attack enemy on sight and don't quit until dead.
	- Cowardly: Will flee battle when weakened, will also shout for other enemies nearby.
	- Healer: Will check nearby enemies and if their HP is low, then it will heal. Will also flee battle.
3. Enable a sleep mode for enemies. They will wake up if player is nearby. Also have them fall alseep when wandering.
4. For sleep mode, set variables for likelyhood to fall asleep and how hard they sleep.

-- Battle System --
1. Since battle system is very simple, just one attack, we will just need one attack script that can be attached to player and enemy.
2. In attack script there is a method that is a void, it's parameters is attacker and target.
3. Simply do the damage calculation and then subtract that calculation from target's health.
4. This method will be called in the enemies run AI method. For the player it will be done when player walks into an enemy.

-- Camera Control --
1. If mouse is near the edge of the screen then scroll the camera that direction.
2. If player moves in any way, then move the camera to be centered on player.

-- Doors, Keys, and Chests --
1. Start off by making a dummy inventory system. Basically just a list of Items, which before this you should make a base item with an item script.
2. Create a chest that can be opened by player, this will set a bool and change the sprite to be an opened chest.
3. Next, add an ItemContained variable to chest, this will be a packed scene, however when chest is opened it doesn't need to be added as child, just add the object to the list.
4. Create a door that when the player walks into it, it will disappear.
5. The next step will be a locked door. It will work off the same script, just add an enum for Lock State.
6. When player walks into locked door it will go thru inventory, if player poesses the correct key, then the door will disappear and key is removed from inventory.

-- Potions --
1. Potions will only raise or lower health.
2. Make a base potion with some variables such as HP and Name. A reference to the player will also be stored here.
3. Finally create a function that can be called from inventory system. This will change the players health. Also check if player is still alive after consuming potion

-- Equipment --
1. Although majority of this will be handled with the UI, the footwork will be established here.
2. All equipment is based on the script Equipment.cs
3. There will be a node attached to the player called Equipment which will have a script called EquipmentManager.cs
4. In the equipment.cs script it will basically just be a holder for variables, which would be Name, ATK, DEF, and HP
5. In the EquipmentManager.cs script will hold the funtions for adding and removing equipment and variables for which piece of equipment is equipped where.
6. There will only be an equippable sword and armor, nothing else.

-- Leveling Up --

-- UI / Inventory System --
1. For equipment menu, when the icon for Weapon or Armor is clicked the equip menu will be made visible.
2. The icon buttons will send information to the equipment menu telling it what to do.
3. It needs to set the name of the type of equipment it is setting at the top.
4. Next a foreach loop needs to be ran for the inventory.
5. It will check for any equipment that is of the given type, if it is equipped it will set the label of the currently equipped item.
6. For any unequipped weapons if will add a button to the scroll container in equipment menu.
7. When button is clicked, the equipment will be equipped and the menu will close.
